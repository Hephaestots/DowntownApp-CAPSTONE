SEG4910.11 - Downtown App - CAPSTONE

**Note**: More key requirements will be added after the next meeting with client.

## Outline

### Project H

The pandemic created new logistical opportunities for social gatherings.  
The concept of hybrid workspaces is now the norm, and the idea of hybrid social spaces  
is also an emerging reality. While some people are still quite comfortable meeting in  
public, many other are not. This doesn't mean that there needs to be different  
activities created for each group, rather a new delivery model and event coordination  
models make it possible for both groups to coalesce around a shared topic at the same  
event.

Also, the ability to deploy an event across multiple channels simultaneously is also a  
topic for creative research.

A minimal viable product (MVP) has been created but is now in need of an overhaul  
and re-platforming.
