### OUTLINE {#outline}

The pandemic created new logistical opportunities for social gatherings. The concept of hybrid workspaces is now the norm, and the idea of hybrid social spaces is also an emerging reality. While some people are still quite comfortable meeting in public, many other are not. This doesn't mean that there needs to be different activities created for each group, rather a new delivery model and event coordination models make it possible for both groups to coalesce around a shared topic at the same event.
